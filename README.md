# python1

now that I have ubuntu installed
need below

0) keep track of every service and its details from which account things are added or updated including id's and passwords
1) integrate github account with ubuntu
1) create python programs (decide how to divide them) - small applications like sending reminders using email, sms. calendar program, note and reminder taking etc
2) install postgresql
*) google sheet integration - any change made to a google sheet and take it as an input and work accordingly and save to database
*) CI/CD deployments for two, develop and prod, any updates to either of them should be deployed
5) maybe my server is not always running, so it should be able to identify changes to code push and also for running cron job for sql and reminders etc - scheduler
5) dockerization
*) auto update sql and make a copy periodically


I now want to make ubuntu as a server for me 
I want to create a python program to run multiple small applications like sending reminders using email, sms. calendar program, note and reminder taking etc 
I want to store these in databases like postgresql 
also want a way that my code should be able to pick any change made to a google sheet and take it as an input and work accordingly and save to database 
and work further also this program I want to store in github and also make sure that as soon as I push this, 
first would be in a develop branch which should be triggered automatically to testing to my pi 5, and other stable version should be up and running always to work help me how to achieve this 
also am thinking to use docker for this, what is your thoughts on this? 
and how to automatically keep updated of sql on pi 5 to some place from time to time

This is a great plan! Let's break it down step by step to ensure your Raspberry Pi 5 is set up as a fully functional server with Docker, PostgreSQL, GitHub integration, Google Sheets syncing, and CI/CD for automatic deployments.

Step 1: Install and Set Up Docker
Since you want to run multiple applications and keep them isolated, Docker is a great choice.

1. Install Docker on Raspberry Pi
bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install docker.io -y
Add your user to the Docker group to run commands without sudo:

bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
Then, reboot:

bash
sudo reboot
Verify Docker is running:

bash
docker --version
Step 2: Set Up PostgreSQL in Docker
We'll run PostgreSQL inside a Docker container to store notes, reminders, and Google Sheets data.

1. Create a PostgreSQL Container
bash
docker run --name postgres-db -e POSTGRES_USER=admin -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=secret -e POSTGRES_DB=mydb -p 5432:5432 -d postgres
POSTGRES_USER=admin: Username for the database.
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=secret: Change this to a strong password.
POSTGRES_DB=mydb: Your main database name.
2. Verify PostgreSQL is Running
bash
docker ps
Step 3: Set Up Google Sheets Integration
To detect changes in Google Sheets, weâ€™ll use the Google Sheets API.

1. Enable Google Sheets API
Go to Google Cloud Console â†’ Enable Google Sheets API.
Create Service Account Credentials.
Download the JSON key file and store it on the Raspberry Pi.
2. Install Required Python Packages
bash
pip install gspread pandas
3. Sample Code to Read Google Sheets and Save to PostgreSQL
python
import gspread
import psycopg2
from oauth2client.service_account import ServiceAccountCredentials

# Google Sheets authentication
scope = ["https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds", "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive"]
creds = ServiceAccountCredentials.from_json_keyfile_name("your-key-file.json", scope)
client = gspread.authorize(creds)

# Open Google Sheet
sheet = client.open("Your Sheet Name").sheet1
data = sheet.get_all_records()

# Connect to PostgreSQL
conn = psycopg2.connect(database="mydb", user="admin", password="secret", host="localhost", port="5432")
cur = conn.cursor()

# Insert data into PostgreSQL
for row in data:
    cur.execute("INSERT INTO your_table (column1, column2) VALUES (%s, %s)", (row['Column1'], row['Column2']))

conn.commit()
cur.close()
conn.close()
This script can be scheduled to run periodically (using cron) to fetch updates from Google Sheets.

Step 4: Automate Deployment with GitHub & CI/CD
To automatically deploy updates when you push to GitHub, we can use GitHub Actions + Docker.

1. Push Your Code to GitHub
Create a repository and push your project:

bash
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push origin main
2. Set Up GitHub Actions to Deploy on Raspberry Pi
Create .github/workflows/deploy.yml in your repo:

yaml
name: Deploy to Raspberry Pi

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - develop  # Change this for stable vs. testing deployment

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Deploy to Raspberry Pi
        run: |
          ssh pi@your-pi-ip "cd /home/pi/your-project && git pull && docker-compose up --build -d"
This ensures:

Any push to develop branch triggers an update on your Pi.
The stable version remains untouched until you merge develop into main.
Step 5: Auto-Backup PostgreSQL
To automatically backup the database, we can schedule a cron job.

1. Create a Backup Script
Create a file backup.sh:

bash
#!/bin/bash
DATE=$(date +%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S)
docker exec postgres-db pg_dump -U admin mydb > /home/pi/postgres-backups/backup_$DATE.sql
Make it executable:

bash
chmod +x backup.sh
2. Schedule It with Cron
Run:

bash
crontab -e
Add:

bash
0 2 * * * /home/pi/backup.sh
This runs the backup daily at 2 AM.

Step 6: Running Your Application as a Docker Container
Since you want multiple small apps (reminders, notes, etc.), each can be a Docker container.

Example docker-compose.yml
yaml
version: '3'
services:
  database:
    image: postgres
    container_name: postgres-db
    restart: always
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: admin
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: secret
      POSTGRES_DB: mydb
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    volumes:
      - db-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

  app:
    build: .
    container_name: my-python-app
    restart: always
    depends_on:
      - database
    environment:
      DB_HOST: database
      DB_USER: admin
      DB_PASS: secret
      DB_NAME: mydb

volumes:
  db-data:
To Start the Application
bash
docker-compose up -d
Final Thoughts
âœ… Dockerized Python App with PostgreSQL.
âœ… Google Sheets Integration for live updates.
âœ… CI/CD Pipeline to auto-deploy on Raspberry Pi via GitHub Actions.
âœ… PostgreSQL Auto-Backup for safety.

This setup will make your Raspberry Pi a fully functional, self-updating personal server! ðŸš€
